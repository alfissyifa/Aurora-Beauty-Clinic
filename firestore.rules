/**
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset enforces a clear separation between public, read-only data and private, backend-managed data. 
 * The primary goal is to expose catalog-like information (services, testimonials) to all clients while protecting
 * sensitive booking information (appointments) and administrative data.
 *
 * Data Structure: The data is organized into four distinct, top-level collections: /services, /testimonials, /appointments, and /admins.
 * There are no user-specific subcollections or nested data structures, which simplifies the security model.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Public Read-Only Collections: /services and /testimonials are configured to be publicly readable by anyone. All write operations are denied.
 * - Public Create for Appointments: /appointments allows any client to create a new document. Read, update, and delete operations are denied to protect privacy.
 * - Conditional Admin Creation: The /admins collection has the most restrictive rules. A new admin document can ONLY be created if the collection is currently empty.
 *   This ensures that only the very first admin can be registered. Once one admin exists, no new ones can be created from the client.
 * - Restricted Admin Data: Only authenticated admin users (those whose UID is in an /admins document) can read the list of admins.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization: Not applicable in this model, as there are no user-specific authorization requirements.
 *
 * Structural Segregation: The use of separate top-level collections is a core part of the security design.
